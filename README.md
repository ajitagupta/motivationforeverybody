The problem also isn’t a lack of willpower, even though conventional
wisdom would have us think that greater willpower is what separates the
achievers from the dreamers.

# Motivation Is Not the Spark
I thought motivation was a
prerequisite to starting a tedious learning process—a spark necessary to get me
going. But motivation is really a result. Motivation is the fire that starts burning
after you manually, painfully, coax it into existence, and it feeds on the
satisfaction of seeing yourself make progress. The problem with waiting for
motivation to strike is that it almost never comes with enough voltage to actually
get you started.

Most people are confused about the source of motivation. They think
motivation is the spark that automatically produces lasting eagerness to do hard
work; the greater the motivation, the more effort you’re willing to put in.
Actually, motivation is a result. Motivation is the pride you take in work
you have already done—which fuels your willingness to do even more.
That’s why tips for how to feel more motivated often fall short. Most of that
advice can be boiled down to “You can be more motivated. All you have to do is
dig deep into your mind and find that motivation within.”

Small successes are fun—and motivating.
That’s why you already have everything you need.
That’s why motivation isn’t something you have. Motivation is something
you get, from yourself, automatically, from feeling good about achieving small
successes.

The key is to enjoy the feeling of success that comes from improving in
some small way . . . and then rinse and repeat, over and over again.

Hopefully you see where this is going. Each little success is motivating.
Each little success gives you confidence. The accumulation of small successes
makes the process, um, maybe not fun, but definitely rewarding—and that’s all
you need to keep going.

In short, the process looks like this:
Success → Motivation → More Success → More Motivation → More
Success = Becoming

# The Greater Your Focus, the Lower Your Chances of Success
Incredibly successful people set a goal and then focus all their attention on
the process necessary to achieve that goal. They set a goal and then, surprisingly,
they forget the goal.
Sure, the goal is still out there. But what they care about most is what they
need to do today—and when they accomplish that, they are happy about today.
They feel good about today.
They feel good about themselves because they’ve accomplished what they
set out to do today, and that sense of accomplishment gives them all the
motivation they need to do what they need to do when tomorrow comes—
because success, even tiny, incremental success, is the best motivational tool of
all.

To accomplish anything worthwhile, and especially to achieve a goal others
say is impossible, you have to work your ass off. There are no shortcuts. The
only way is the hard way.

The key is to set a goal, use it as a target that helps you create a plan for
achieving it . . . and then do your best to forget all about that goal.
As I learned
from James Clear, a leading thinker on the subject, the best use of a goal is to
inform the process you will follow to achieve it.
What’s the difference between a goal and a process?

* If you’re a manager, your goal is to develop your employees. Your
process is how you identify areas for improvement, create implementation
plans, follow through on training and coaching and feedback. Your
process is what you do to make your goal happen.
* If you’re a teacher, your goal is to help your students reach their potential.
Your process is how you craft your lectures, create slides and ancillary
materials, find ways to motivate individual students. Your process is what
you do to make your goal happen.
* If you’re a parent, your goal is to raise healthy, happy kids. Your process
is how you build your children’s self-confidence and self-esteem, nurture
their dreams, instill important values. Your process is what you do to
make your goal happen.

Everyone has goals. The people who actually achieve their goals create
routines. They build systems. They consistently take the steps that, in time, will
ensure they reach their ultimate goal.They don’t wish. They don’t hope.
They just do what their plan says, consistently and without fail.
They forget the goal and focus solely on the process.

Forgetting Your Goal Unleashes the Power of Feedback. If your process is one designed to get you where you eventually want to go,
all you have to do is work your process—and sticking with your process is so
much easier when you create that self-reinforcing feedback loop of Success →
Motivation → More Success → More Motivation → More Success.

1. Start with a fast day.
2. Exercise first thing every morning.

Inevitable success is the best success of all—and it will happen when you
set your goal, forget your goal, and focus on working your process.
