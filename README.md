# Motivation for Everybody

Motivation is known to be a prerequisite to starting a tedious learning process - a spark necessary to get you going. In this post, we uncover the myths behind what motivation really is and where to get it from. This is for everyone who hasn't achieved ... yet!


## Motivation Is Not the Spark

The problem isn't a lack of willpower, even though conventional wisdom would have us think that greater willpower is what separates the achievers from the dreamers. The real problem is *motivation*.

Most people are confused about the source of motivation. They think motivation is the spark that automatically produces lasting eagerness to do hard work; the greater the motivation, the more effort you’re willing to put in. Actually, motivation is a **result**. Motivation is the pride you take in work you have already done-which fuels your willingness to do even more. Motivation is the fire that starts burning after you manually, painfully, coax it into existence, and it feeds on the satisfaction of seeing yourself make progress.

The problem with waiting for motivation to strike is that it almost never comes with enough voltage to actually get you started. There is only one recipe for gaining motivation: **success**. Not huge, life-changing successes, but small ones. Small successes are fun—and motivating. That’s why you already have everything you need. That’s why motivation isn’t something you have. Motivation is something you get, from yourself, automatically, from feeling good about achieving small successes.

Each little success is motivating. Each little success gives you confidence. The accumulation of small successes makes the process rewarding-and that’s all you need to keep going.

## The Greater Your Focus, the Lower Your Chances of Success
Incredibly successful people set a goal and then, surprisingly, they forget the goal.

Sure, the goal is still out there. But what they care about most is what they need to do today—and when they accomplish that, they are happy about today.
They feel good about today. They feel good about themselves because they’ve accomplished what they set out to do today, and that sense of accomplishment gives them all the motivation they need to do what they need to do when tomorrow comes — because success, even tiny, incremental success, is the best motivational tool of all.

The key is to set a goal, use it as a target that helps you create a plan for achieving it . . . and then do your best to forget all about that goal. The best use of a goal is to inform the process you will follow to achieve it. What’s the difference between a goal and a process? Your process is what you do to make your goal happen.

* If you’re a manager, your goal is to develop your employees. Your process is how you identify areas for improvement, create implementation plans, follow through on training and coaching and feedback. 
* If you’re a teacher, your goal is to help your students reach their potential. Your process is how you craft your lectures, create slides and ancillary materials, find ways to motivate individual students.
* If you’re a parent, your goal is to raise healthy, happy kids. Your process is how you build your children’s self-confidence and self-esteem, nurture their dreams, instill important values.


## How to Create a Successful Process

Here is what you need to do in order to succeed.

1. Set your goal (e.g. running a marathon, losing 40 kg)
2. Set aside decision anxiety and choose a reasonably promising routine: just pick a process (that matches your current fitness level). Don’t worry about which training program is "best", especially because you have no way of knowing which program is best for you.
3. If necessary, customize your process to be extremely specific (e.g. run 2 km on Monday, Tuesday....): A good process tells you precisely what you need to accomplish at every step along the way. That way you know exactly what to do, and you know when you have actually accomplished what you need to do.
4. Rework your schedule: All your training will naturally take time, and freeing up that time means changing your current routine. Maybe you’ll stop lifting weights. Maybe you’ll start getting up earlier.
5. Map out your daily plan
6. Work the process. Maybe that first 2 km run was too hard and you had to walk some portion of it. That’s okay; just make sure you complete the 2 km.
7. Your results may vary, so adapt accordingly. For example, most people need greater time to recover from exercise as they age - our bodies don’t recover as quickly from high-intensity or long-duration workouts.

Inevitable success is the best success of all — and it will happen when you set your goal, forget your goal, and focus on working your process.


## Happiness Comes to Serial Achievers
Think about what you do well, or would like to do well, and, most important, would really enjoy doing. Don’t choose an "and" you feel you should choose. Pick a side hustle your inner twenty-year-old will love. Being a serial achiever is a chance to explore, to delve, to expand, even to indulge - but with a purpose.

The beauty of serial achievement is that over time you become more than one thing. You can be a Web designer and a musician and an athlete . . . and then you can become something else as well, knowing that when you have achieved a certain level of skill or experience you can work to achieve something else.

If you're not happy, rethink your definition of success. The one you have is not working for you. You can’t have it all. You shouldn’t want to have it all
because that’s the best way to wind up unhappy and unfulfilled. But you can have a lot more than you currently do, whether what you want more of is professional or personal success. So start pursuing the goals that will make you happy. Because success isn’t truly success . . . unless you’re happy.


## To Gain Incredible Willpower . . . Need Less Willpower

Willpower isn’t something you either have or don’t have. Here are some tips you can start using today to help you accomplish what you want to accomplish, without needing to possess incredible willpower - or, really, any willpower at all. The process starts with designing your life so it supports your goals.

Step 1: Eliminate as many choices as possible<br/>
Step 2: Make decisions tonight so you won’t need to make them tomorrow<br/>
Step 3: Do the hardest things you need to do first<br/>
Step 4: Refuel often<br/>
Step 5: Create reminders of your long-term goals<br/>
Step 6: Remove temptation altogether


## One Question Provides Nearly Every Answer
Ask yourself, “Will this keep me
from following my process?”
If it will, don’t do it.
Process is everything. Routine is everything.
Let nothing stand in its way.


## You Don’t Need a Coach; You Need a Pro

Stop comparing yourself with yourself. Stop comparing yourself with the people around you. Go see a superstar in action. Whether it’s a speaker, a musician, a performer, an athlete, or an entrepreneur, find a way to expose yourself to exceptional skill, exceptional expertise, and exceptional talent.

When you spend time with a superstar, when you try to do what the pros do, that experience will automatically ratchet your own internal limits to a higher level. While you may never be as good, when superstar performance is your bar, you automatically set your goals higher - and that makes you achieve more. Stop comparing your present self with your past self. Start comparing your present self - regardless of how far you think you have already come - with what is actually possible.

Embrace the challenge, embrace the "pain," embrace the fact that you will stretch and push yourself beyond your normal limits . . . because every time you do, you’ll feel motivated to do it again.


## The Bottom Line
If you have doubts or fears, you’re not alone. Everyone else has, or had, the same fears. Take heart in that fact - and then hold your leg down and keep charging. You’ll find you had nothing to be afraid of . . . and that you can overcome other fears you may have.

If you’re feeling low, put your head down and focus on your process. You’ll improve - and you’ll gain the motivation you feel you lack.

Your dreams are important, but your plan is what will allow you to achieve your goals and live out your dreams. Don’t wait for motivation. Get started. Work your plan. When you do, you’ll find all the motivation you need.
