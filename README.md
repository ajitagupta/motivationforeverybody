The problem also isn’t a lack of willpower, even though conventional
wisdom would have us think that greater willpower is what separates the
achievers from the dreamers.

### Motivation Is Not the Spark
I thought motivation was a
prerequisite to starting a tedious learning process—a spark necessary to get me
going. But motivation is really a result. Motivation is the fire that starts burning
after you manually, painfully, coax it into existence, and it feeds on the
satisfaction of seeing yourself make progress. The problem with waiting for
motivation to strike is that it almost never comes with enough voltage to actually
get you started.

Most people are confused about the source of motivation. They think
motivation is the spark that automatically produces lasting eagerness to do hard
work; the greater the motivation, the more effort you’re willing to put in.
Actually, motivation is a result. Motivation is the pride you take in work
you have already done—which fuels your willingness to do even more.
That’s why tips for how to feel more motivated often fall short. Most of that
advice can be boiled down to “You can be more motivated. All you have to do is
dig deep into your mind and find that motivation within.”

Small successes are fun—and motivating.
That’s why you already have everything you need.
That’s why motivation isn’t something you have. Motivation is something
you get, from yourself, automatically, from feeling good about achieving small
successes.

The key is to enjoy the feeling of success that comes from improving in
some small way . . . and then rinse and repeat, over and over again.

Hopefully you see where this is going. Each little success is motivating.
Each little success gives you confidence. The accumulation of small successes
makes the process, um, maybe not fun, but definitely rewarding—and that’s all
you need to keep going.

Incredibly successful people set a goal and then focus all their attention on
the process necessary to achieve that goal. They set a goal and then, surprisingly,
they forget the goal.
Sure, the goal is still out there. But what they care about most is what they
need to do today—and when they accomplish that, they are happy about today.
They feel good about today.
They feel good about themselves because they’ve accomplished what they
set out to do today, and that sense of accomplishment gives them all the
motivation they need to do what they need to do when tomorrow comes—
because success, even tiny, incremental success, is the best motivational tool of
all.

To accomplish anything worthwhile, and especially to achieve a goal others
say is impossible, you have to work your ass off. There are no shortcuts. The
only way is the hard way.
