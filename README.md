# Motivation for Everybody

Motivation is known to be a prerequisite to starting a tedious learning process—a spark necessary to get you going. In this post, we uncover the myths behind what motivation really is and where to get it from. This is for everyone who hasn't achieved ... yet!


## Motivation Is Not the Spark

The problem also isn’t a lack of willpower, even though conventional wisdom would have us think that greater willpower is what separates the achievers from the dreamers. The real problem is *motivation*.

Most people are confused about the source of motivation. They think motivation is the spark that automatically produces lasting eagerness to do hard work; the greater the motivation, the more effort you’re willing to put in. Actually, motivation is a **result**. Motivation is the pride you take in work you have already done—which fuels your willingness to do even more. Motivation is the fire that starts burning after you manually, painfully, coax it into existence, and it feeds on the satisfaction of seeing yourself make progress.

The problem with waiting for motivation to strike is that it almost never comes with enough voltage to actually get you started. There is only one recipe for gaining motivation: **success**. Not huge, life-changing successes, but small ones. Small successes are fun—and motivating. That’s why you already have everything you need. That’s why motivation isn’t something you have. Motivation is something you get, from yourself, automatically, from feeling good about achieving small successes.

The key is to enjoy the feeling of success that comes from improving in some small way . . . and then rinse and repeat, over and over again. Each little success is motivating. Each little success gives you confidence. The accumulation of small successes makes the process rewarding—and that’s all you need to keep going.

## The Greater Your Focus, the Lower Your Chances of Success
Incredibly successful people set a goal and then, surprisingly, they forget the goal.

Sure, the goal is still out there. But what they care about most is what they need to do today—and when they accomplish that, they are happy about today.
They feel good about today. They feel good about themselves because they’ve accomplished what they set out to do today, and that sense of accomplishment gives them all the motivation they need to do what they need to do when tomorrow comes — because success, even tiny, incremental success, is the best motivational tool of all.

The key is to set a goal, use it as a target that helps you create a plan for achieving it . . . and then do your best to forget all about that goal. The best use of a goal is to inform the process you will follow to achieve it. What’s the difference between a goal and a process? Your process is what you do to make your goal happen.

* If you’re a manager, your goal is to develop your employees. Your process is how you identify areas for improvement, create implementation plans, follow through on training and coaching and feedback. 
* If you’re a teacher, your goal is to help your students reach their potential. Your process is how you craft your lectures, create slides and ancillary materials, find ways to motivate individual students.
* If you’re a parent, your goal is to raise healthy, happy kids. Your process is how you build your children’s self-confidence and self-esteem, nurture their dreams, instill important values.


## How to Create a Successful Process

Here is what you need to do in order to succeed.

1. Set your goal (e.g. running a marathon, losing 40 kg)
2. Set aside decision anxiety and choose a reasonably promising routine: just pick a process (that matches your current fitness level). Don’t worry about which training program is "best", especially because you have no way of knowing which program is best for you.
3. If necessary, customize your process to be extremely specific (e.g. run 2 km on Monday, Tuesday....): A good process tells you precisely what you need to accomplish at every step along the way. That way you know exactly what to do, and you know when you have actually accomplished what you need to do.
4. Rework your schedule: All your training will naturally take time, and freeing up that time means changing your current routine. Maybe you’ll stop lifting weights. Maybe you’ll start getting up earlier.
5. Map out your daily plan
6. Work the process. Maybe that first 2 km run was too hard and you had to walk some portion of it. That’s okay; just make sure you complete the 2 km.
7. Your results may vary, so adapt accordingly. For example, most people need greater time to recover from exercise as they age - our bodies don’t recover as quickly from high-intensity or long-duration workouts.

Inevitable success is the best success of all — and it will happen when you set your goal, forget your goal, and focus on working your process.


## Happiness Comes to Serial Achievers
Think about what you do well, or would like to do well, and, most important, would really enjoy doing. Don’t choose an "and" you feel you should choose. Pick a side hustle your inner twenty-year-old will love. Being a serial achiever is a chance to explore, to delve, to expand, even to indulge - but with a purpose.

The beauty of serial achievement is that over time you become more than one thing. You can be a Web designer and a musician and an athlete . . . and then you can become something else as well, knowing that when you have achieved a certain level of skill or experience you can work to achieve something else.

If you're not happy, rethink your definition of success. The one you have is not working for you. You can’t have it all. You shouldn’t want to have it all
because that’s the best way to wind up unhappy and unfulfilled. But you can have a lot more than you currently do, whether what you want more of is professional or personal success. So start pursuing the goals that will make you happy. Because success isn’t truly success . . . unless you’re happy.

## One Question Provides Nearly Every Answer
Ask yourself, “Will this keep me
from following my process?”
If it will, don’t do it.
Process is everything. Routine is everything.
Let nothing stand in its way.


## You Don’t Need a Coach; You Need a Pro
Whom you choose to admire—and it is a choice—says more about you than
about that person. We tend to admire certain people because we see something
of ourselves in them. We like to think that what they do and how they do it
indicates what we would do if given the chance.
It doesn’t matter whom you admire. It doesn’t matter whom you look to for
inspiration; you’re seeking more of a blueprint for success. Whom you choose is
important only in that their approach to success will help you achieve your goals.
You can even take a counterintuitive approach and think well outside the
hero box. Think of someone who is extremely successful but whom you would
normally never dream of emulating.

And then, if what you’ve done so far hasn’t taken you where you want to go,
take a bigger swing at the emulation target. Learn as much as you can about that
person and adopt as many of their habits and routines as you possibly can.

Pros show you how to succeed—and
expect you to take full responsibility for your own success.

Stop comparing yourself with yourself. Stop comparing yourself with the
people around you. Go see a superstar in action. Whether it’s a speaker, a
musician, a performer, an athlete, or an entrepreneur, find a way to expose
yourself to exceptional skill, exceptional expertise, and exceptional talent.

When you spend time with a superstar, when you try to do what the pros do,
that experience will automatically ratchet your own internal limits to a higher
level. While you may never be as good, when superstar performance is your bar,
you automatically set your goals higher—and that makes you achieve more. Stop
comparing your present self with your past self.
Start comparing your present self—regardless of how far you think you have
already come—with what is actually possible.
Stop looking back. Start looking forward to see how far you can still go.
And then work hard to get there. Do what the pros do.
You may never be as talented as the absolute best in the field or pursuit you
choose, but you will definitely achieve much more than your self-imposed limits
allowed you to think was ever possible.

Embrace the challenge, embrace the “pain,” embrace the fact that you
will stretch and push yourself beyond your normal limits . . . because every time
you do, you’ll feel motivated to do it again.
And in time you’ll find yourself living the life you want to live.

## Do More by Doing Less
How can you free up time so you can apply other achievement strategies to
the things you do best, and learn to perform those things even better than you
already do? That’s hard, because if you’re already somewhat successful, success tends to
create clutter: more meetings, more projects, more decisions, more items on your
to-do list. But often doing more can mean achieving less. That’s why, once again, subtraction can be the best addition, especially
when you streamline your day and, in the process, your life.
And the easiest way to do that is to start saying no.

In fact, if you want to achieve a huge goal, as well as succeed at all your
other responsibilities, you need to learn how to say no to most things that come
your way. Otherwise other people—and other choices—will place incredible
demands on your most valuable resource: your time. Ask yourself two questions:
1) “Will Doing This Benefit Me in Some Way?”
Ruthlessly evaluate every “opportunity” that comes your way. Remember,
every time you say yes, you take time away from doing what you do best.
Make sure that “yes” is genuinely worth it.
2) “Is This More Important Than What I’m Currently Doing?”
Most of the time you’ll find that what you’re currently doing is more
important. Don’t grab every new shiny thing in the hope that it will somehow
make you happier.

Instead of doing a total professional or personal makeover, the easiest way is to
start small. Here are some basic things to eliminate that will free up chunks of
time to allow you to spend more of your time doing what you do best.

## The Bottom Line
If you have doubts or fears, you’re not alone. Everyone else has, or had, the
same fears. Take heart in that fact—and then hold your leg down and keep
charging. You’ll find you had nothing to be afraid of . . . and that you can
overcome other fears you may have.
If you’re feeling low, put your head down and focus on your process. You’ll
improve—and you’ll gain the motivation you feel you lack.
Your dreams are important, but your plan is what will allow you to achieve
your goals and live out your dreams.
Don’t wait for motivation. Get started. Work your plan.
When you do, you’ll find all the motivation you need.
