The problem also isn’t a lack of willpower, even though conventional
wisdom would have us think that greater willpower is what separates the
achievers from the dreamers.

# Motivation Is Not the Spark
I thought motivation was a
prerequisite to starting a tedious learning process—a spark necessary to get me
going. But motivation is really a result. Motivation is the fire that starts burning
after you manually, painfully, coax it into existence, and it feeds on the
satisfaction of seeing yourself make progress. The problem with waiting for
motivation to strike is that it almost never comes with enough voltage to actually
get you started.

Most people are confused about the source of motivation. They think
motivation is the spark that automatically produces lasting eagerness to do hard
work; the greater the motivation, the more effort you’re willing to put in.
Actually, motivation is a result. Motivation is the pride you take in work
you have already done—which fuels your willingness to do even more.
That’s why tips for how to feel more motivated often fall short. Most of that
advice can be boiled down to “You can be more motivated. All you have to do is
dig deep into your mind and find that motivation within.”

Small successes are fun—and motivating.
That’s why you already have everything you need.
That’s why motivation isn’t something you have. Motivation is something
you get, from yourself, automatically, from feeling good about achieving small
successes.

The key is to enjoy the feeling of success that comes from improving in
some small way . . . and then rinse and repeat, over and over again.

Hopefully you see where this is going. Each little success is motivating.
Each little success gives you confidence. The accumulation of small successes
makes the process, um, maybe not fun, but definitely rewarding—and that’s all
you need to keep going.

In short, the process looks like this:
Success → Motivation → More Success → More Motivation → More
Success = Becoming

# The Greater Your Focus, the Lower Your Chances of Success
Incredibly successful people set a goal and then focus all their attention on
the process necessary to achieve that goal. They set a goal and then, surprisingly,
they forget the goal.
Sure, the goal is still out there. But what they care about most is what they
need to do today—and when they accomplish that, they are happy about today.
They feel good about today.
They feel good about themselves because they’ve accomplished what they
set out to do today, and that sense of accomplishment gives them all the
motivation they need to do what they need to do when tomorrow comes—
because success, even tiny, incremental success, is the best motivational tool of
all.

To accomplish anything worthwhile, and especially to achieve a goal others
say is impossible, you have to work your ass off. There are no shortcuts. The
only way is the hard way.

The key is to set a goal, use it as a target that helps you create a plan for
achieving it . . . and then do your best to forget all about that goal.
As I learned
from James Clear, a leading thinker on the subject, the best use of a goal is to
inform the process you will follow to achieve it.
What’s the difference between a goal and a process?

* If you’re a manager, your goal is to develop your employees. Your
process is how you identify areas for improvement, create implementation
plans, follow through on training and coaching and feedback. Your
process is what you do to make your goal happen.
* If you’re a teacher, your goal is to help your students reach their potential.
Your process is how you craft your lectures, create slides and ancillary
materials, find ways to motivate individual students. Your process is what
you do to make your goal happen.
* If you’re a parent, your goal is to raise healthy, happy kids. Your process
is how you build your children’s self-confidence and self-esteem, nurture
their dreams, instill important values. Your process is what you do to
make your goal happen.

Everyone has goals. The people who actually achieve their goals create
routines. They build systems. They consistently take the steps that, in time, will
ensure they reach their ultimate goal.They don’t wish. They don’t hope.
They just do what their plan says, consistently and without fail.
They forget the goal and focus solely on the process.

Forgetting Your Goal Unleashes the Power of Feedback. If your process is one designed to get you where you eventually want to go,
all you have to do is work your process—and sticking with your process is so
much easier when you create that self-reinforcing feedback loop of Success →
Motivation → More Success → More Motivation → More Success.

# Your Goal Must Always Choose Your Process
1. Start with a fast day.
2. Exercise first thing every morning.
3. Eat four almonds fifteen minutes before every meal.
4. Drink a glass of water right before every meal.
5. Always stop eating the moment you start to feel full.
6. Don’t eat anything white.
7. Make sure every meal is healthy.
8. Toss in a snack.
9. Burn about five hundred extra calories a day.
10. Cheat wisely.
11. Keep a food journal.
12. Check off each step in the process.

Inevitable success is the best success of all—and it will happen when you
set your goal, forget your goal, and focus on working your process.

So what is the best way to say no to yourself? It’s easy: Stop saying “can’t”
and start saying “don’t.”
It works. Science says so. Researchers conducted a study:
1. YOU CAN’T MAKE EXCUSES TO YOURSELF.
2. YOU COME ACROSS AS MORE CONFIDENT.
3. YOU WON’T GET AS MUCH PUSHBACK ON YOUR
RESOLUTIONS.

# Happiness Comes to Serial Achievers
So go ahead. Be a professional serial achiever. Embrace your “and.” Take
the steps that let you include an “and” in the way you describe yourself
professionally.

Think about what you do well, or would like to do well, and, most
important, would really enjoy doing. Don’t choose an “and” you feel you should
choose. Pick a side hustle your inner twenty-year-old will love. Being a serial
achiever is a chance to explore, to delve, to expand, even to indulge—but with a
purpose.

Maybe starting a small business on the side would be fun. Maybe teaching
or consulting or working part time or volunteering or going back to school
would be fun. It doesn’t matter what “and” you choose, as long as it is
something you really want to do.
Then you get to recharge and refresh, pick up new perspectives, and bring
certain skills back to your primary role . . . or roles.

The beauty of serial achievement is that over time you become more than one
thing. You can be a Web designer and a musician and an athlete . . . and then
you can become something else as well, knowing that when you have achieved a
certain level of skill or experience you can work to achieve something else.
Plus, the skill you gain will not be wasted if or when you move on to
another pursuit. Except for unusual skills—like tech skills, which are constantly
on the verge of becoming obsolete even for full-time programmers and
developers—the skills you gain will stay in your tool kit. While over time you
will naturally lose some degree of proficiency, you will always retain the core
skill and will be able to quickly tune yourself up again if necessary.
Think of it this way: Strength is hard to build the first time, but regaining
strength lost is much easier.

If you’re not happy, rethink your definition of success. The one you have is
not working for you. You can’t have it all. You shouldn’t want to have it all
because that’s the best way to wind up unhappy and unfulfilled.
But you can have a lot more than you currently do, whether what you want
more of is professional or personal success.
So start pursuing the goals that will make you happy.

That’s another thing no one tells you about goals. You may want it to be one
way—the way that lets you pursue anything you want without regard to money
or health or relationships—but it’s the other way.
And it always will be. Just ask anyone who ignored the basics in his life (it’s
almost always men) to pursue a goal . . . only to feel empty and hollow because
the “trophy” on the mantel came at too high a cost.
Happiness requires evenly balancing your multiple nonnegotiable goals,
blending in a negotiable goal where appropriate . . . and never, ever forgetting to
self-evaluate along the way to ensure the balance never gets out of whack. For
brief periods of time it’s okay if that balance is off, but do that for long, and
everything falls apart: your motivation, your confidence, your small successes—
and ultimately, your happiness.

Because success isn’t truly success . . . unless you’re happy.

To make it simple, answer these two questions.
Are You Comfortable Financially?
Are You Relatively Fit and Healthy?

# Wishing and Hoping Is the Most Unrealistic Approach of All
Set a goal.
Then look at what is required to achieve that goal. What you need to do may
not be what you want to do, and that’s okay. Let everyone else take an
unrealistic approach and then wonder why they aren’t achieving more.
Be “unrealistic” when you set a goal, and then be realistic about how you
will achieve that goal.
Then your goal will become realistic, because you have a plan in place that
will allow you to achieve that goal.
Dream as big as you like. Then make sure your plan matches your dream.

# To Gain Incredible Willpower . . . Need Less Willpower
The purpose of this book is to help you achieve huge goals. But
accomplishing a huge goal takes time.
So let’s start small. Success → Motivation → More Success → More
Motivation creates an awesomely virtuous cycle, so why not gain some
immediate successes that will motivate you to knock off even bigger goals?
And while we’re at it, let’s do so in a way that helps you develop an
attribute most people feel they struggle with—willpower—and, in the process,
make willpower irrelevant.
Are we trying to accomplish multiple things at once? Absolutely. The best
processes not only let you achieve an immediate goal but also help you gain
skills and confidence that allow you to achieve other goals.

Step 1: Let everyone know you won’t be available.
Step 2: Decide how long you will work.
Step 3: Don’t just set a deadline. Totally commit to hitting that deadline.
Step 4: Start your EPD at an unusual time.
Step 5: Delay and space out your rewards.
Step 6: Refuel before you think you need to refuel.
Step 7: Take productive breaks, not relaxation breaks.
Step 8: Take your breaks at a counterintuitive moment.
Step 9: Don’t stop until you’re done—even if finishing takes longer than expected.

Willpower isn’t something you either have or don’t have.
Here are some tips you can start using today to help you
accomplish what you want to accomplish, without needing to possess incredible
willpower—or, really, any willpower at all.
The process starts with designing your life so it supports your goals.
Step 1: Eliminate as many choices as possible.
Step 2: Make decisions tonight so you won’t need to make them
tomorrow.
Step 3: Do the hardest things you need to do first.
Step 4: Refuel often.
Step 5: Create reminders of your long-term goals.
Step 6: Remove temptation altogether.
