I thought motivation was a
prerequisite to starting a tedious learning process—a spark necessary to get me
going. But motivation is really a result. Motivation is the fire that starts burning
after you manually, painfully, coax it into existence, and it feeds on the
satisfaction of seeing yourself make progress. The problem with waiting for
motivation to strike is that it almost never comes with enough voltage to actually
get you started.

Small successes are fun—and motivating.
That’s why you already have everything you need.
That’s why motivation isn’t something you have. Motivation is something
you get, from yourself, automatically, from feeling good about achieving small
successes.

Incredibly successful people set a goal and then focus all their attention on
the process necessary to achieve that goal. They set a goal and then, surprisingly,
they forget the goal.
Sure, the goal is still out there. But what they care about most is what they
need to do today—and when they accomplish that, they are happy about today.
They feel good about today.
They feel good about themselves because they’ve accomplished what they
set out to do today, and that sense of accomplishment gives them all the
motivation they need to do what they need to do when tomorrow comes—
because success, even tiny, incremental success, is the best motivational tool of
all.
